# My Java and OOP Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my repository!  
Here I’ll be uploading my projects and exercises while learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** with **Java**.  
This repo is basically my personal playground to practice, make mistakes, and (hopefully) get better at coding 😅.

---

## 📝 What You’ll Find Here
- Small **exercises** to practice Java and OOP basics.
- **Mini-projects** where I combine different concepts.  
- Random experiments while exploring Java.  

---

## 🎯 Why I’m Doing This
I want to:
- Understand **how OOP really works** (not just in theory).  
- Get comfortable writing **cleaner and reusable code**.  
- Have fun while learning and keep track of my progress.  

---

## 🛠 Tools I’m Using
- **Java**
- **VS Code**  
- **Git & GitHub** to track my journey  

---

## 🌱 Next Steps

- **Add more exercises as I go deeper into OOP.**
- **Build small apps that connect multiple concepts.**
- **Maybe even try out design patterns in the future.**

## 🤝 Feedback?

If you see something I could improve, feel free to open an issue or drop a suggestion.
I’m here to learn, and any advice is more than welcome 🙌.

## ✨ Note

This repo is just a reflection of my learning process. Some code might be messy at first, but that’s part of the journey 😉.
